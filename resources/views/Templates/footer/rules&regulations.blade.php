   <hr/>
   <p>Hello buddies! I’ll be taking you around, not in a Lamborghini this time, but through our rules, your rules. No, we aren’t being uptight, just simples rules. The ones you’re familiar with. We’re not about stopping you from enjoying your time here; the rules are just so you and other members get the best experience.
</p>
<h4>At the General Forum:</h4>
<ol style="list-style: unset;">
  <li>Don’t spam, it irritates others.
</li>
  <li>Don’t insult people, their religion, or tribe. We don’t want people sustaining e-injuries.

</li>
  <li>Fraudulent schemes aren’t allowed on CampusCabal.

</li>
  <li>Don’t threaten other members. Unknowingly, they might be seated next to you. No one enjoys fights.</li>
  <li>We understand you need to get your product to others, post them at the appropriate section.

</li>
<li>Shun rumours, always verify information before posting them on CampusCabal.
</li>
<li>Obey moderators, they’re your friends.
</li>

</ol>

<h4>At the Campus Forum:
</h4>
<ol style="list-style: unset;">
  <li>Don’t insult students from your institution or other institutions.

</li>
  <li>Don’t share course materials with misleading content.

</li>
  <li>Don’t promote cultism on CampusCabal.

</li>
  <li>Don’t scam aspirants of your institutions or other institutions.
</li>
 
</ol>
<h4>At the Marketplace section:

</h4>
<ol style="list-style: unset;">
  <li>Don’t post fraudulent ads. Don’t scam other members.

</li>
  <li>Ads should contain accurate specifications and information. Don’t advertise a smart phone and sell a “dull” one.


</li>
  <li>Don’t repost adverts. If you do, we’ll surely know. To get your ads to the top page, simply update them.

</li>
  <li>Don’t advertise substandard or expired goods. Avoid posting dangerous ads.

</li>
 <li>Don’t post adverts of immoral nature. We’re not enforcing religious ads on you; no! Just ensure the ad doesn’t contravening societal morals.


</li>
</ol>
<h4>At the events section:</h4>
<ol style="list-style: unset;">
  <li>Don’t post fake events. Other members might be all dressed up expecting to attend such events. No one enjoys being fooled.
</li>
  <li>Events posted should contain accurate information. Don’t claim there’ll be “abundant item 7” when indeed we’ll enter another world war to get sachet water.
</li>
  <li>Events shouldn’t be reposted. Do you seek wider viewership? Don’t worry, just update it, and it’ll be seen by a larger audience.
</li>
  <li>Verify the type of event. Don’t invite people to dangerous events. We at CampusCabal are keen about your safety and that of others.</li>
  <li>Don’t post past events. Invite others earlier. They, too, may wish to be in attendance.
</li>
